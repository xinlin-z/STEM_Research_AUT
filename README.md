# STEM_Research_AUT
Couresework of my STEM Research course at AUT

I trained and evaluated everything on kaggle, where I can have a free GPU. So, all codes are in notebook format, enjoy...

* training.ipynb: main training code, index for images files is pre-made, support save models to disk and resume training process at any checkpoint
* evaluation.ipybn: evaluation code, load model and evaluate on two test dataset
